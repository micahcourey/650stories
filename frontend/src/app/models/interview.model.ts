She holds three passports and speaks English, Spanish, and Portuguese fluently. Calling herself a “global nomad” she says that one of the hardest questions for her to answer is: ‘Where are you from?’ She has two children and an 8-year-old boxer who responds to commands in English, Spanish and Portuguese.",

//   question_text: "Where did you grow up?",
//   answer_text: "I was born and raised in Mexico City, both of my parents were born in Mexico City, and I went to college in Mexico City. I married young at 23, and my husband and I ended up moving to Florida for five years. I worked in marketing for Ericsson, then it was Sony Ericsson—the mobile phones. I was the marketing manager for Latin America. My oldest son was born in Florida, and when he was six weeks old, we moved to Seattle for eleven long months.",

//   question_text: "How was moving to Seattle?",
//   answer_text: "I went from being an executive and working and having my support system to being a stay-at-home mom. I didn’t have a support system and it was dark. I had two Swedish friends who were also wives of Microsoft guys. But I thought I was a burden to them, because when I saw them they had to switch to talking in English. We lived in the suburbs which was horrible. My son’s name is Diego and every day my neighbor would ask, “How is Diablo doing?” It wasn’t a happy place.",

//   _id: "5a88cb7fee4fba4ddcf19dde",
//   question_text: "So then what led you out of there?",
//   answer_text: "We were both unhappy and so we moved to New York City. What a change. It was great because I grew up in a big city. Moving to New York was a breath of fresh air. Even though the weather was harsher, there were so many more opportunities. We also knew from our experience in Seattle that we needed to tell people we were moving there, and make sure to contact people. I wasn’t shy. I knew I had to reach out and build a support system. I asked people where I should live and what I should do. We moved to the Upper East Side which is very family oriented which made sense because our son had just turned one. We were there for five years. Our daughter was born there, and because it was the dot com era I had an online tea shop.",
